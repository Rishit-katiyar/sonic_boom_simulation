# Sonic Boom Simulation ðŸš€ðŸ’¥

Welcome to the Sonic Boom Simulation repository! This Python script allows you to simulate and visualize shock wave propagation, resembling the generation and propagation of a sonic boom wave.

## Description

The Sonic Boom Simulation script utilizes numerical methods to simulate the generation and propagation of shock waves from a point source. It provides a 3D visualization of the shock wave as it expands over time.

Sonic booms are the loud sounds resulting from shock waves created by any object moving through the air faster than the speed of sound. Understanding the dynamics of shock wave propagation is essential in various fields, including aeronautics, acoustics, and fluid dynamics.

This simulation script offers an educational and insightful tool for exploring the physics behind sonic booms and other shock wave phenomena.

## Installation

To use the Sonic Boom Simulation script, follow these installation instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/sonic_boom_simulation.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd sonic_boom_simulation
```

3. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
python sonic_boom_simulation.py
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the Sonic Boom Simulation script, you can run it with the default parameters or customize the simulation according to your preferences.

### Default Parameters Mode

In the default parameters mode, the script uses predefined parameters for the simulation:

- Source position: (0, 0)
- Speed of propagation: 0.5
- Start time: 0
- End time: 2
- Number of time steps: 10

To run the script with default parameters, simply execute the following command:

```bash
python sonic_boom_simulation.py
```

### Customized Parameters Mode

In the customized parameters mode, you can input your own parameters for the simulation. Follow the prompts to enter the desired values for the source position, speed of propagation, start time, end time, and number of time steps.

```bash
python sonic_boom_simulation.py
```

## Visualization

The Sonic Boom Simulation script provides a 3D visualization of the shock wave as it propagates over time. The visualization includes:

- A surface plot representing the pressure distribution in 3D space.
- Contour lines to visualize the shock wave fronts.
- Axis labels and limits for clarity.
